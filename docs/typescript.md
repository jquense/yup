## TypeScript Support

`yup` comes with robust typescript support! However, because of how dynamic `yup` is
not everything can be statically typed safely, but for most cases it's "Good Enough".

Not that `yup` schema actually produce _two_ different types: the result of casting an input, and the value after validation.
Why are these types different? Because a schema can produce a value via casting that
would not pass validation!

```js
const schema = string().nullable().required();

schema.cast(null); // -> null
schema.validateSync(null); // ValidationError this is required!
```

By itself this seems weird, but has it uses when handling user input. To get a
TypeScript type that matches all possible `cast()` values, use `yup.TypeOf<typeof schema>`.
To produce a type that matches a valid object for the schema use `yup.Asserts<typeof schema>>`

```ts
import * as yup from 'yup';

const personSchema = yup.object({
  firstName: yup
    .string()
    // Here we use `defined` instead of `required` to more closely align with
    // TypeScript. Both will have the same effect on the resulting type by
    // excluding `undefined`, but `required` will also disallow empty strings.
    .defined(),
  // defaults also affect the possible output type!
  // schema with default values won't produce `undefined` values. Remember object schema
  // have a default value built in.
  nickName: yup.string().default('').nullable(),
  gender: yup
    .mixed()
    // Note `as const`: this types the array as `["male", "female", "other"]`
    // instead of `string[]`.
    .oneOf(['male', 'female', 'other'] as const)
    .defined(),
  email: yup.string().nullable().notRequired().email(),
  birthDate: yup.date().nullable().notRequired().min(new Date(1900, 0, 1)),
});
```

You can derive the TypeScript type as follows:

```ts
import type { Asserts, TypeOf } from 'yup';

const parsed: Typeof<typeof personSchema> = personSchema.cast(json);

const validated: Asserts<typeof personSchema> = personSchema.validateSync(
  parsed,
);
```

You can also go the other direction, specifying an interface and ensuring that a schema would match it:

```ts
import { string, object, number, SchemaOf } from 'yup';

type Person = {
  firstName: string;
};

// ✔️ compiles
const goodPersonSchema: SchemaOf<Person> = object({
  firstName: string().defined(),
}).defined();

// ❌ errors:
// "Type 'number | undefined' is not assignable to type 'string'."
const badPersonSchema: SchemaOf<Person> = object({
  firstName: number(),
});
```

### TypeScript settings

For type utilties to work correctly with required and nullable types you have
to set `strict: true` or `strictNullChecks: true` in your tsconfig.json.

### Extending built-in types

You can use TypeScript's interface merging behavior to extend the schema types
if needed. Type extensions should go in an "ambient" type def file such as your
`globals.d.ts`.

```ts
declare module 'yup' {
  class StringSchema<TIn, TContext, TOut> {
    myMethod(param: string): this;
  }
}
```

> Watch out!: If your method needs to adjust schema generics, you likely
> need to also extend the Required*, and Defined* interfaces associated with
> each basic type. Consult the core types for examples on how to do this
